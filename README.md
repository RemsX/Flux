Flux
====

A web app/page that is a easy, Pretty, Quick way of looking up Tide, Moon Phase, Dusk and Dawn.


Tenenants:
Simple (one url, grabs origin zipcode, displays on load)
  (then one form only to put in a different zipcode)
  What is the easiest way of displaying this all in glance to read format

Pretty ( use Nice Graphing / simple elegant design)
  Should be classy and modern, Style should be almost as important as ease of use


Might make for an easy Python/Flask Starter project, .js? perhaps?

Will host @ www.nonapp.com/flux, and guage interest from there :)
